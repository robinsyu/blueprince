                    <p>
                        Upon reaching a closed door in Mt. Holly, you decide what room appears behind it from a choice of three options.
                        Each decision shapes your path as you navigate through the manor. Every door can reveal new and exciting chambers
                        that contain their own unique challenges and secrets.

                    <p>
                        Your progress each day is shaped by the rooms you select to draft and the tools you find within them.
                        Items in the game can be used in creative ways to fuel your exploration deeper into the house,
                        allowing you to adopt unique strategies to combat the challenges that each day brings.

                        As your journey takes you further into the mansion's depths, you start to discover that there is more
                        lurking under the surface than a missing room. Investigate a past woven with the threads of blackmail,
                        political intrigue, and the mysterious disappearance of a local children's book author.
